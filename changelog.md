## 2024-07-30

### Added
- Created `.gitignore` file to exclude common development artifacts and sensitive information.
- Updated `.env` file to include specific LLM models for OpenAI, Anthropic (Claude), Google, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, and X/Grok.
- Updated `.env` file to include specific HuggingFace image generation spaces: `black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell` and `evalstate/flux1_schnell`.

### Fixed
- Corrected `.env` file path loading in `main.py` to ensure it's loaded from the project root.
- Created a placeholder `ui/streamlit_app.py` to resolve missing file errors when launching the Streamlit interface.
- Ensured `google-api-python-client`, `PyQt6`, and `streamlit` are explicitly listed in `requirements.txt` to address missing dependency errors.

### To Do
- Implement the full Streamlit UI (`ui/streamlit_app.py`).
- Enhance error handling and user feedback for missing API keys and dependencies.
- Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests for all core modules.
- Refactor `main.py` to use a more robust configuration management system (e.g., `pydantic` settings).
- Implement a proper dependency check and installation mechanism within the application startup.
